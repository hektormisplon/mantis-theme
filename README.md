Mantis
==========

*Mantis* is a dark gray theme with 3 variants for Xfce.   
It's existence comes from a need for an easy-on-the-eyes workstation theme.

*Mantis* is the first iteration and has the highest contrast of the three.
*Mantis Dusk* strikes a nice balance between ease-of-use and looks.
*Mantis Night* is a very flat dark theme that doesn't work well in every setup, but I included it anyway.


The GTK 2 widget themes are based on Xfce-Simple-Dark (https://github.com/trustable-code/Xfce-Simple-Dark)  
Basic GTK3 support exists and is lifted from my dark gray spin of the Arc theme (https://github.com/mantissa-/arc-pro-theme)

Xfce panel theming is basic, but it works.

Two wallpapers have also been added to the archive, for anyone who's interested.

Tested on Xubuntu 17.10 & 18.04, YMMV.
